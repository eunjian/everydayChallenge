# Algorithm Challenge: Diverse Problem Solving

This is for a month-long algorithm challenge. Over the four weeks, from Monday to Friday, challenge myself with a diverse array of algorithmic problems. This challenge is designed to simulate conditions similar to corporate coding tests and will expose me to the latest types of problems commonly encountered in those assessments.

---
**Challenge Structure:**

Solve one algorithmic problem each day, Monday to Friday.

- Week 1: Implementation Focus
  - Problems will be centered around implementation and coding logic.

- Week 2: Exhaustive Search Emphasis
  - Focusing on exhaustive search techniques.

- Week 3: Exploration and Dynamic Programming
  - Encounter problems involving search strategies and dynamic programming.

- Week 4: Graph Exploration
  - In the final week, encounter problems that involve graph traversal and exploration.

Throughout the challenge, it is possible to be exposed to a variety of problem-solving techniques and strategies, enhancing algorithmic skills and preparing myself for diverse coding assessment scenarios.

**Personal Record:**

While participating in this challenge, I can maintain a personal record of my solutions and progress. To keep track, consider uploading my solutions to your GitHub repository. This will not only showcase my dedication but also serve as a valuable resource for future reference.
