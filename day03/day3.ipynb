    "# Sum Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical calculators can display only one calculation result at a time. Consequently, when multiple calculation results are needed, it's cumbersome to keep track of previous results separately.\n",
    "To address this issue, the player has developed a sum calculator. The sum calculator has the capability to receive multiple calculations($T$) as input and then output the sum of all individual calculation results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input expressions for the sum calculator must satisfy the following conditions:\n",
    "- The calculation expression follows the format: `<integer> <operator> <integer>`.\n",
    "- \\<operator> can be one of the four arithmetic operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The remainder from division is discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set number of calculation($T$) expressions for the sum calculator, determine the final output result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first line contains the number of expressions, $T$, and $1 \\le T \\le 100$.\n",
    "- The next lines each contain a calculation expression.\n",
    "- Each calculation expression follows the format: `<integer> <operator> <integer>`.\n",
    "- \\<integer> will be an integer ranging from 1 to 1000. \n",
    "- \\<operator> will be one of the characters: +, -, *, /. Each representing addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the result of calculations obtained from the sum calculator.\n",
    "\n",
