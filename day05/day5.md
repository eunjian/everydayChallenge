# **Binary Integer Sorting**

### **Problem**

---

Given $N$ decimal integers, the player is asked to sort the integers according to the following criteria, as the task of simply sorting integers is deemed too easy:

1. Sort the decimal integers in descending order based on the number of $1$'s present when represented in binary.
2. If the number of $1$ is the same, sort them in descending order based on their original decimal values.

When the player successfully sorts the integers, let's find out what value is located at the $K$ th position from the front.

### **Input**

---

The first line consists of two integers $N$ and $K$, separated by a space, denoting the number of given integers and the position of the integer the player is trying to find.
The second line consists of integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_N$, separated by spaces.

- $1 \leq N \leq 500,000$
- $1 \leq K \leq N$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 2^{20}$

### **Output**

---

Print the value that is located at the $K$ th position from the front, among the integers sorted according to the specified criteria.
