    "The player serves as the project manager (PM) and the sole developer of the Cloud Project. To successfully complete the Cloud Project, $N$ feature developments are necessary. Each feature is numbered from 1 to $N$, and it takes $c_i$ minutes to develop the feature with the number i.\n",

    "To meet the project's deadline, the player initiates work during the night shift. The player starts working at $T$ hours and $M$ minutes. The player sequentially progresses through the development of features from 1 to $N$. As soon as the development of one feature is completed, the development of the next feature begins. Determine the time at which the player completes the development of all features.\n",
